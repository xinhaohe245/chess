# Installation Instructions #

To run our Chess game, navigate to the project's root directory. 
Please make sure that your terminal is set to light/white mode so that the 
Chess pieces display with proper colors. Then, you can call "sh chess.sh" 
to start a game of Chess in the terminal.

Upon starting the game, you will have 2 options: loading a game from a text file 
or playing a regular game from the beginning.
If you want to load a game after a specific sequence of moves, you can add the
moves as a text file in the data directory. There are examples of a good file
and a bad/invalid file in that directory as a guide.
To load a game from a text file, enter just the file name when prompted.
The "data/" prefix and ".txt" postfix will be automatically appended.

After you have chosen what game to play, you will have another option: whether to
have a timer or not. If you want to have a timer, you can choose any number of
minutes between 1.0-60.0. If you do not want a timer, simply enter "untimed" or "casual". 

You are ready to play our game of Chess! If you need any assistance while playing,
you may find the Help and Rules commands helpful. Enjoy!
