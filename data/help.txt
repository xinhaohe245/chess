Notation: each square on the board is referred to by a letter and a number. The letter 
  represents the column, while the number represents the row. Example: the third square 
  of the second row is notated as c7. 

The black pieces are located on rows 7 and 8, while the white pieces are located on 
rows 1 and 2.

Rules for Piece Movement (Credit to ichess.net):
Kings move one square in any direction, so long as that square is not attacked by an 
  enemy piece. Additionally, kings are able to make a special move, known as castling.

Queens move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically any number of squares. They are 
  unable to jump over pieces.

Rooks move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. They are unable to jump 
  over pieces. Rooks move when the king castles.

Bishops move diagonally any number of squares. They are unable to jump over pieces.

Knights move in an ‘L’ shape’: two squares in a horizontal or vertical direction, then 
  move one square horizontally or vertically. They are the only piece able to jump over 
  other pieces.

Pawns move vertically forward one square, with the option to move two squares if they 
  have not yet moved. Pawns are the only piece to capture different to how they move. The 
  pawns capture one square diagonally in a forward direction.
  Pawns are unable to move backward on captures or moves. Upon reaching the other side of 
 the board a pawn promotes into any other piece, except for a king. Additionally, pawns 
  can make a special move named En Passant.
